# Test-Task-Inweba

This project is a pixel-perfect layout for a test task. It was built with pure HTML and CSS to meet provided design specifications.

### Requirements

- [x] Reproduce the layout in code as accurately as possible.
- [x] Pay special attention to matching fonts, colors, element sizes, and the overall appearance.
- [x] Responsive design is not required.

### [Layout](<https://www.figma.com/design/Z30BC9EFEf5t6NmBbgplx0/PROJECT---Dickens-Academy-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=9oSNrb2MP02V1MsZ-0>)

### Features

1. **Pixel-perfect design:** The layout closely matches the provided design specifications, ensuring visual accuracy.
2. **Interactive Elements:** All interactive elements, such as buttons, logos, and links, include hover effects to improve user experience and highlight interactivity.

### Responsive Design

This layout is currently not responsive. Given the time constraints for this test task and the need to balance multiple assignments, I focused on achieving pixel-perfection for a fixed screen size. Additional time would be required to make the layout fully responsive across devices, which I am prepared to implement if needed.

### Possible Enhancements

1. **Responsive Layout:** While this project was delivered as a static layout, it can be enhanced with a responsive design to better support multiple screen sizes.
2. **JavaScript Integration:** For further optimization, all data could be stored in objects and rendered dynamically using JavaScript. This would streamline code management and enable more flexibility in updating content. However, this was not specified as a requirement for this task and would require additional time to implement.
